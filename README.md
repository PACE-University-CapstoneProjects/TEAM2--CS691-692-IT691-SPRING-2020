Title: Symbolic Set Theory for Scientists: A Computer Science Perspective

Team Member: Paula Medina

Abstract: Computer scientists perceive that they have limited
needs of set theory. Set theory is used in problem complexity
descriptions that characterize algorithms and that is the end of it.
However, the computing environment has changed fundamentally
in two ways. One, techniques to compute with extremely large
numbers - possibly infinite numbers - are revealing immense
value in artificial intelligence, increasing the demand to be ever
better at this. Two, computational ability is passing Moore’s
Law’s constraints, as Moore’s law becomes trivial once we pass
the matter-to-energy boundary of quantum computing. To adapt
to these changes, we present here that symbolic set theory gives us
tools to expand our understanding and enable ideas of greater
experience in computer science. Classical axiomatic set theory
is based upon the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms plus the axiom of
choice. Set theory creates unimaginably large sets, populated by
mostly undefinable elements. The mathematical ”real line” is
such a set. This is useless. Computer scientists need symbolic
models for real phenomena. Symbolic sets are well defined sets of
symbolic elements which we construct with suitably constrained
axioms. The definite (pronounced de-fine’-ate) real line is such a
set. It contains just the well defined elements of the real line and it
is sufficient for numerical scientific computation. This paper takes
a constructive point of view that makes it less abstract and more
accessible and and to illustrate its influence in computer science
beyond the 20th century. To use symbolic set theory, the computer
scientist needs an acquaintance with discrete mathematics and
with convergent sequences, and we shall define here the other
concepts.
